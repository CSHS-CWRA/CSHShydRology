\title{Functions for Canadian hydrological analyses}
\description{
\pkg{CSHShydRology} is intended for the use of hydrologists, particularly those in Canada. It will contain functions
which focus on the use of Canadian data sets, such as those from Environment Canada. The package will also contain functions which
are suited to Canadian hydrology, such as the important cold-region hydrological processes. \pkg{CSHShydRology} will also contain
functions which work with Canadian hydrological models, such as Raven, CRHM, Watflood, and MESH.

This package has been developed with the assistance of the Canadian Society for Hydrological Sciences (CSHS) \url{https://cshs.cwra.org/en/}
which is an affiliated society of the Canadian Water Resources Association (CWRA) \url{https://cwra.org/}.

The \pkg{CSHShydRology} will contain functions grouped into several themes, including:
\describe{
\item{Statistical hydrology}{trend detection, data screening, frequency analysis, regionalization}
\item{Basic data manipulations}{input/conversion/adapter functions, missing data infilling}
\item{Visualization}{data visualization, standardized plotting functions}
\item{Spatial hydrology}{basin delineation, landscape data analysis, working with GIS}
\item{Streamflow measurement analysis}{rating curve analysis, velocity profiles, naturalization}
\item{Network design/analysis}{homogeneity assessment}
\item{Ecohydrology}{fisheries and ecological analysis}
\item{Wrappers/unwrappers}{between other packages and \pkg{CSHShydRology}}
}
