\title{Distance in seasonal space}
\usage{
DistSeason(x, ...)

\method{DistSeason}{numeric}(x, a, w = 1/pi, ...)

\method{DistSeason}{data.frame}(x, w = 1/pi, ...)

\method{DistSeason}{formula}(form, x, w = 1/pi, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, a}{Coordinates in the seasonal space. 
Can be a data.frame or vectors with radius `x` and angle `a`.}

\item{...}{Other parameters.}

\item{w}{Weight to favor angle over radius. 
By default it is 1/pi, which bring angle in the interval [0,1].}

\item{form}{Formula and dataset providing the coordinates of the
seasonal space. Must be of the form `radius ~ angle`.}
}
\description{
Return a matrix of distances between points in the seasonal space that
characterizes timing and regularity.
It is equivalent to Euclidean distance applied to regularity (radius)
and timing (angle) separately.
}
\examples{

scoord <- data.frame(radius = runif(5), 
                     angle = runif(5,0,2*pi))

DistSeason(radius ~ angle , scoord)
