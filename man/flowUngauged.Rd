\description{
The L-moments of the annual maximums at 562 stations
were extracted from Water Survery of Canada (HYDAT).
Catchment descriptors are available for each station was
provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).
The best at-site distributions according to the AIC criterion are included.
